# Running JavaScript Code with Node.js

## Procedure
1. Create a Javascript file with the ".js" extension.

2. Open the Terminal or IDE of choice.

3. In the file, write Javascript code. Below, a comment and a variable has been declared. 
```
// Write a comment starting with two "//" and then write a sentence or comment afterward

// Make a Variable
var variable_1 = 3;
```
4. In JavaScript, to output a variable, the "console.log()" is used to print a variable. 
```
// Write a comment starting with two "//" and then write a sentence or comment afterward

// Make a Variable
var variable_1 = 3;

// Output a variable with console.log. In the terminal run "node" and the file name of the javascript file.
console.log(variable_1);
```
5. Below is the methodology of writing a function and printing it out with "console.log()":
```
// Writing a Function
function name_of_function() {
    return "Hello";
}

// Printing it with console.log
console.log(name_of_function())
```
### Run a JavaScript File
6. To see the output of the variable and function, in the Terminal or IDE, type "node" and then the name of the JavaScript file in this format:
```
node name_of_file.js
```
Node must be installed before running this command (1)
